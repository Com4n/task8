To generate the input file (mat.in), a Python script (generate_large_test_file.py) was used. This script creates a file with more than 100,000 lines, each line containing a matrix of random '1's and '0's with dimensions specified at the start of each line.

Example of mat.in content:
5x10:11010111001000111110101101110100001111111100000001
9x5:110010101011010100000001001101010111111100111
5x3:010101100011101

The mat.py program reads this input file, processes each matrix to count isolated '1's, clusters of two '1's, and clusters of three '1's, and writes the results to mat.out.

To demonstrate the correctness, here is an example:

mat.in
5x4:00010100010110000001

The matrix is:
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1

mat.out
3 0 1
